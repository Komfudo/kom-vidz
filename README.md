#GO UPDATE

so i decided to my crap to masterpiece. git clone that shit, make sure you have like go 1.19 installed on your server, i think you need to do go install but if it's not working then i'm a dumbass and i will gonna search solution like a idiot, and then compile it with go build. after that i should make a socket and systemd with nginx's proxy but i will gonna use screen and nginx's proxy instead.
